"""Network device connection helpers using Netmiko.

This module wraps common tasks when interacting with network devices
over SSH using the `netmiko` library.  By hiding connection setup
inside helper functions, scripts can focus on highâ€‘level logic.  All
functions respect environment variables for credentials and attempt to
handle common error conditions gracefully.

Netmiko must be installed in your Python environment (see
``requirements.txt``).  Supported device types include Cisco IOS
variants such as ``cisco_ios`` and ``cisco_xe``.  Refer to the
Netmiko documentation for a full list of supported platforms.
